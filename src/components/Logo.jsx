/**
 * ## The Message Behind the New Logo
 * 
 * I've redesigned the logo to be more symbolic and to visually represent the name "Echo Expedition". 
 * The new design is sleek, modern, and packed with meaning that reflects the app's core purpose.
 * 
 * - **The Speech Bubble:** The foundation of our logo remains the speech bubble, the universal symbol for 
 *   communication, conversation, and language. It immediately grounds the app in its purpose: helping you 
 *   master spoken English.
 * 
 * - **The Expedition Path & Mountain:** Inside the bubble, you'll now see a stylized mountain range with a 
 *   path climbing towards the summit. This is the "Expedition." It represents your personal journey from 
 *   foundational knowledge to the peak of fluency. Each lesson is a step forward on this path, a new 
 *   height achieved.
 * 
 * - **The Echo Waves:** Radiating from the mountain peak are two sound waves. This is the "Echo." They 
 *   symbolize the app's core mechanic: listening to a prompt (the sound) and repeating it (creating an echo). 
 *   Itâ€™s through this cycle of listening, speaking, and receiving feedback that your pronunciation and 
 *   confidence grow.
 * 
 * Together, the new logo tells the story of a guided journey. It visually communicates that Echo Expedition 
 * is your partner in the adventure of mastering English, turning every word you speak into a confident step 
 * towards the summit of fluency.
